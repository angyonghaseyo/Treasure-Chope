# Treasure Chope

Treasure Chope is a pioneering platform that marries the concept of sustainability with the convenience of local food delivery. Our mission is to bridge the gap between local businesses and consumers, promoting a sustainable approach to food consumption. Through Treasure Chope, users can purchase 'surprise boxes' of surplus food from local eateries, providing savings for both consumers and businesses, while contributing to significant waste reduction.
